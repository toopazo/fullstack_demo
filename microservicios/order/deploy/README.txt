Build the project: Run the gradle build or ./gradlew build command in the terminal. 
This command compiles the code, runs tests, and assembles the application into a JAR file. 
The Spring Boot plugin automatically configures the bootJar task, which creates an executable JAR.

Locate the JAR file: The JAR file is created in the build/libs directory.

Run the JAR file: Execute the JAR file using the command java -jar <artifact-name>.jar from the build/libs directory.
